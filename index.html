            <h3>Why We Started AI Bizlutions</h3>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>AI Bizlutions was founded to solve a problem that too many operations leaders face every day: powerful tools exist, but they are complex to integrate, difficult to fully utilize, and often fail to deliver sustained value once deployed.</p>
                
                <p>Across industries, organizations struggle with fragmented systems, manual processes, missed opportunities, and teams stretched thin trying to manage growth with disconnected technology. AI and automation promise efficiency, but without proper integration, governance, and ongoing management, they quickly become underused software rather than operational assets.</p>
                
                <p><strong>AI Bizlutions exists to close that gap.</strong></p>
                
                <p>We don't sell tools — we deliver managed, integrated AI solutions designed around how a business actually operates. Our approach focuses on understanding operational pain points, embedding AI directly into workflows, and continuously supporting and optimizing those systems over time.</p>
                
                <p>By combining operational discipline with technical execution, we help small and mid-sized organizations gain the same advantages as larger enterprises — without the need to build internal teams or taking on unnecessary complexity.</p>

    <!-- Chase's Story Modal -->
    <div id="chaseModal" class="modal">

            <span class="modal-close">&times;</span>
            <h3>Chase's Story</h3>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>I didn't come to AI from the traditional tech background — I came to it from high-consequence operations.</p>
                
                <p>I started my career as a floor mechanic, wrenching on aircraft, moved through supervisory and quality systems, ultimately serving as the <strong>Accountable Manager and Head of Fleet Operations</strong> — fully responsible for the safety, airworthiness, and operational performance of over 100 aircraft across multiple international locations.</p>
                
                <p>In that role, safety wasn't a department — it was the foundation. Every process had to be validated. Every decision had to be defensible. <strong>Failure didn't mean lost revenue or bad reviews; failure meant lives at risk.</strong></p>
                
                <p>At the same time, aviation operates on razor-thin margins. Efficiency and safety are inseparable. Processes must be precise, repeatable, and continuously improving. Automation wasn't about convenience — it was about reducing human error, improving response time, and protecting both people and profitability.</p>
                
                <p>That mindset shaped my entire career and carried into later work in continuous improvement, business analytics, and strategic insight for leadership, including extensive use of tools like Power BI to drive better decisions.</p>
                
                <p>What I kept seeing — especially in service-based and multi-location businesses — was the same breakdown: missed calls, slow follow-ups, disconnected systems, and manual work pulling attention away from revenue-generating activity.</p>
                
                <p>Hiring full internal teams to build and maintain these systems is expensive and unrealistic for most organizations. After many tools are installed, many businesses are left managing software they don't fully understand.</p>
                
                <p><strong>That's why I started AI Bizlutions.</strong></p>
                
                <p>We serve as the integration layer, embedding AI directly into how a business actually operates — from call handling and lead capture to follow-up, scheduling, and internal workflows. We bring operational rigor, safety-first thinking, and execution-focused design.</p>
                
                <p>Between my background in operational excellence and risk management, and my brother/partner's expertise in automation architecture and customer-facing systems, we deliver complete, reliable solutions — giving small and mid-sized businesses the same operational advantages large corporations get from dedicated teams, without the direct overhead.</p>
                
                <p><strong>AI Bizlutions isn't about replacing people.</strong></p>
                
                <p>It's about building systems that perform under pressure — because where I come from, successful execution equals life.</p>

            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>I have always been intrigued by computers. When I was young I found myself editing video, 3D modeling, and playing with Linux.</p>
                
                <p>I taught myself how to code and launched my career as a software engineer over the last decade.</p>
                
                <p>I quickly found myself obsessing over automating my daily tasks. <strong>I started turning heads when I was completing 7 times the amount of work expected of me in my role.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Chase and I started AI Bizlutions to bring the power of automation into the hands of businesses that need it.</p>
